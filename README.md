Static Blog Website

This is a simple static blog website built using React. It offers a clean and responsive design, making it perfect for sharing articles, tutorials, or personal thoughts. Since it's fully static, it can be easily hosted on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel without any backend setup.
